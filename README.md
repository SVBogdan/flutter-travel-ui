# Travel app UI

I made this app with the help of [dbestech's Travel App Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4DydJKVvQk)


## Why I made this app
This project is a starting point for a person who wants to learn Flutter.

It helped me learn about : Dart, Widgets, How UI's are created in Flutter, Assets, State managment, Device preview, and many others.
